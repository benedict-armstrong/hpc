\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first bug is a compile-time bug. The \texttt{\#pragma} directive must be followed by a for loop. In this case we have a \texttt{tid = omp\_get\_thread\_num()} statement immediately after the \texttt{\#pragma}. This is not allowed. The fix is to move the \texttt{tid} assignment into the for loop.
    \item There are a couple of errors in the code. The variable \texttt{tid} should be made explicitly private as every thread is writing to it. In the last \texttt{for} loop the total sum should be marked as a reduction variable (using the \texttt{reduction(+:total)} clause). Also by default the second loop will not spawn any new threads as the option \texttt{OMP\_NESTED} is set to \texttt{FALSE} by default (see \href{https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/xl-c-aix/13.1.2?topic=openmp-omp-nested}{IBM OpenMP documentation}).
